1) Suppose a person wants to calculate the simple interest in the account he has taken for specified number of years. Read values from the user
> si = (prin * rate * time) / 100

2) Accept name, roll number and field of interest from the user and print
in the below format: My name is abc and my roll number is 123. My field of interest is xyz.
> print("My name is {0} and my roll number is {1}. My field of interest is {2}".format(name, roll, interest))

3) Write a python program which accepts the radius of a sphere and computes the volume and surface area.
> sa = 4(pi)r^2
> v = 4/3 pi r^3

4) Write a python program to find the gravitational forces acting between two objects of given masses

5) Write a python program to read 4 characters separately from the user. Convert every character to its next alphabet
> c1 = chr(ord(c1)+1)

6) If the person leaves home at 6:52 am, and runs1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at a tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time does the person get back home for breakfast?
> sec1 = 8 * 60 + 15
> sec2 = 7 * 60 + 12
> total = 2 * sec1 + 3 * sec2
> conv to min and hrs

7) Write a python program to clear the right most set bit of a number. (flip it too)
> ans = n & (n-1)

8) Write a python program
a) to get a single random character from a specified string
> ch = random.choice(name)

b) that does the following:
i) shuffle students in class (10 students)
> random.shuffle()
ii) to choose one student who would become a class rep
> random.choice()
iii) to create a random sample of size 2 from the available number of population who are the potential candidates to become event coordinators
> random.sample(x,2)

c) calculate multiplication of two random float numbers
> random.random()
> random.uniform(9.5, 99.5)
> ans = a * b

9) Generate a random floating point number within a range

10) Generate the same random number every time.
> random.seed(x) # default is the system time

11) Roll a die in such a way that every roll gives the same number
