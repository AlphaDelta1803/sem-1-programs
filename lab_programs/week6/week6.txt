1) Write a program to count the number of Vowels in a given string and store in separate list.

2) Write a python program to perform the following operations using given list as input:
a) Create separate lists of strings and numbers.
b) Sort the strings list in ascending order
c) Sort the number list from lowest to highest
d) Sort the number list from highest to lowest

3) Given a heterogeneous list, create separate lists for different types of data. Write a python program to achieve the same.
l_int = []; l_float = []; l_str = []; l_tuple = []; l_list = []; l_set = []
for i in oglist:
    c = type(i)
    if c == int:
        l_int.append(i)
    if c == float:
        l_float.append(i)
    if c == str:
        l_str.append(i)
print()

4)Write a python program to find the frequency of the largest element in a list. List may contain duplicates.
List1 = [11,22,88,53,88,53,88]
largestCount = count(max(List1))

5) Write a python program to find the sum of diagonal elements in nested 2D list.
list_2D = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
sum = 0
for i in range(len(list_2D)):
 sum = sum + list_2D [i][i]
print(sum)

6) Write a python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
values = input("Enter values separated by commas: ")
list = values.split(",")
tuple = tuple(list1)
print(tuple, list)

7) Write a Python program to find the repeated items of a tuple.
tuple1 = (2,4,5,6,2,3,4,4,7)
n = int(input(enter number to check))
count_rep = tuple1.count(n)
