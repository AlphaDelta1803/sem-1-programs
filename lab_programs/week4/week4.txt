1. WAP which uses a while loop to sum the squares of integers (starting from 1) until the total exceeds 200.
Print the final total and the last number to be squared and added.
n = 0 while total < 200:, num = num + 1, total = total + num ** 2

2. WAP which keeps prompting user to guess a word. The user is allowed up to 10 guesses. Write your code in such a way
that the secret word and the number of allowed guesses are easy to change. Print messages to give the user feedback.
guesses = None, while (guess != word AND guess_left > 0):, if correct, gg, else guess_left = guess_left - 1

3. WAP that will read three numbers into variables named a, b and c and print a message informing the user whether
they are a pythagorean triplet.

4. Check whether a given date is valid. If yes, find the next date. Consider leap year as well.
(take year, check if leap year, take month no, and set a max date, then check if the date entered
is between 1 and max date, if yes, check if month number is between 1 and 12, if dd == max date and
month != 12, then dd = 1 and mm +=1, if dd == max date (nested if) month = 12, then y+1 as well, else dd+1)
yy%4 == 0 and (yy%100 != 100 or yy%400 == 0)

5. WAP to read the values of a, b, c and produce a message saying how many roots the quadratic equation
has and their forms
d = b**2 - 4*a*c
if d == 0, return real and equal, d > 0, return real ad distinct, d < 0, return imaginary
if imaginary, sqrt(-d)/2a = imaginary and -b/2a = real, else imaginary = sqrt(d)/2a

6. Some programs ask tge user to imput a variable number of data enteries, and finally to enter a specific character or string (called a sentinel) which signifies that there are no more entries. WAP t which averages positive integers. your program shou;dnprompt the user to enter integers iuntil the user enters a negative integer. The negative int should be discarded and you should pront avg of all previously entered integers
if n < 0, break while True: loop to get numbers
avg = float(sum(list)/len(list))

7. WAP to add the digits of a positive number repeatedly until the result has a single digit. if 59, 5+9=14, 1+4=5
num = (num-1)%9 + 1

8. WAP that reads two integer values n and m from the user and then produces a box that is n wide and m deep.

n = columns, m = rows
i = 0
while (i < m):
j=0
while(j < n):
if (i == 0 or i == m - 1 or j == 0 or j == height - 1):
print('@', end=' ')
else:
print(' ', end = ' ')
j = j + 1
i = i + 1
print()
